A Rails + Angular app. Not sure what we're doing with it for now.

To view frontend:
1) navigate to "public"
2) run "npm start"
3) in browser, navigate to "localhost:8000"
4) navigate to "angular_app"
and voila!

To setup the backend: 
1) Ensure you're in the root directory of the project.
2) Switch to ruby 2.1.2 by using the command `rvm use 2.1.2`
3) Run `bundle install`
4) Make sure you copied the database.yml file from Slack into the config folder
5. Run `rails s` to start your Rails server!
